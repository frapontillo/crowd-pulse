lemmatize-morphit
=================

The `lemmatize-morphit` plugin needs two files in the class loader accessible resources directory:

- `morphit` contains a list of terms, lemmas and related POS tag (fetch it from the [official website]
(http://sslmitdev-online.sslmit.unibo.it/linguistics/morph-it.php)).
- `tanl-morphit` contains a mapping from TANL and MorphIT POS tags (included in this repo).
