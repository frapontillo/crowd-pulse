rem-stop-word-simple
====================

The `rem-stop-word-simple` plugin needs a series of stop words files in the class loader accessible 
resources directory, in the form of:

    stop-words-LANGUAGE
    
`LANGUAGE` is the two-characters representation of the language.

You can download stop words files for some languages [here](https://github.com/frapontillo/stop-words).
