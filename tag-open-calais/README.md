tag-open-calais
===============

The `tag-open-calais` plugins needs a `opencalais.properties` file with a `opencalais.key` property.

**IMPORTANT**: this module is currently based on the old version of Open Calais, for which there's 
currently [no way to get API keys](http://www.opencalais.com/APIkey).
This module will be rewritten to support the [new version of Open Calais](http://new.opencalais.com/).
